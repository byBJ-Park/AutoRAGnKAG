1 release dates
    navy nurse is believed to have been released in 1954
    the face in the fog was released around 1962

2 director birth years
    directors active in the mid50s such as those who may have worked on navy nurse were likely born in the early to mid20th century potentially around the 1920s or 1930s
    directors active in the early 60s like those involved with the face in the fog might have been born slightly later perhaps in the late 1930s or early 1940s

    given that the face in the fog was released a few years after navy nurse its director is likely to have been born slightly later than the director of navy nurse

correct answer ebtissam mohamed is younger than beekman du barry

wait nothat cant be right because if beekman was born in 1775 and ebtissam in the late 20th century beekman would definitely be older so i think i made a mistake earlier let me clarify

 if beekman was born in 1775 and ebtissam in 1936 beekman is older
